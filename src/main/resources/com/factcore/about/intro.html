    <h2>Goals &amp; Motivation</h2>

    <p>The Scorpio<sup>4</sup> toolchain was designed to automate mundane model-driven development tasks - loading data, extracting meta-data, enrichment, transformation, execution, exporting and exposing services.</p>

    <p>With Scorpio<sup>4</sup>, you describe what you mean, not how you want to achieve it.
        Scorpio<sup>4</sup> does the how based on logical rules that you can create, re-use and share with others.</p>

    <p>The Scorpio<sup>4</sup> execution engine supports declarative, event-driven, programming.
        For many scenarios this is easier to create, maintain, extend and re-use than the traditional approach using familiar programming paradigms and languages. When it isn't, you have the full power of Java or dozens of traditional <a href="scripts.html">scripting languages</a> to get the job done.</p>

    <p>Each item of information is understood in it's context, given it a rich semantic knowledge.
        We employ an industry standard (SPARQL Rules) to logical derive new understandings, or executable actions from the meaning contained within your information model.</p>

    <p>Since each instruction, is itself, an RDF statement then 's possible to document and annotate the source with statements about requirements, constraints, validation rules,
        use cases, workflows, or maybe bugs and workarounds.
