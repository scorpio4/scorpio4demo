    <h2>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> - From Data to Wisdom</h2>

    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> turns your data into knowledge, and your knowledge into action. We call that <b>Wisdom Management</b>.</p>
    <p>Your data lives in multiple places, in a plethora of formats and technologies. Scorpio<sup>4</sup> provides a rich suit of tools to extract, integrate, export and expose them to other parts of your business.</p>

    <p>For complex business, such as health care and financial services, if we don't drive our businesses off of actionable data then we're not going to be here much longer.</p>

    <h4>An Executable Source of Truth</h4>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> is a semantic solution enablement toolkit. It is equally well suited for model-driven development, master data management, content management, enterprise integration and cloud orchestration.</p>
    <p>By using RDF as a modelling language, Scorpio makes is easier than ever to build robust online or offline agile, adaptive applications that integrate and collaborate with people and systems, intelligently.</p>
    <p>Every part of your software solution is linked. Your meta-data describes your data. Your user inferface is derived from the same. Your validation rules are link. Your business processes consume and produce data according to your source of truth model.</p>

    <h4>Linking and Inferencing</h4>
    <p>Your requirements, bugs, features and benefits can all be linked with the appropriate parts of your application.</p>
    <p>In most cases, you can use logical rules to infer one sub-system from another. At least during prototype and minimum viable product (MVP) stages.</p>

    <h4>Intelligent Integration</h4>
    <p>Imagine a simple database, 3 tables - customers, orders and products. For each table, we need a data entry screen. For each field in the data schema, we need a field onscreen. When the schema states we have relationships, they imply validation rules.</p>
    <p>With a few simple transformations, you can scan your SQL schema then automatically derive the queries, models and UI that makes up your app. Make a change and regenerate. Everything stays linked.</p>
