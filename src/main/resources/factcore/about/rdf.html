    <h2>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> RDF</h2>
    <p>Back in the early days of the World Web Web, it's founder (Sir Tim Berners-Lee) realised a flaw. We had a "web of pages" but we needed a "web of data".</p>
    <p>RDF is the data model for the semantic web and linked data. It's a structured database, that uses schema to build inferences rather than impose constraints</p>
    <p>Whilst wide-scale adoption of the semantic web has been slow, and the enterprise exploitation has been lack lustre that is partly because tool sets were not available.
        Without tools, developers are not productive and adoption is sluggish. We hope that Scorpio<sup>4</sup> plays a small role in promoting the myriad of use cases that Linked Data enables and simplies.</p>

    <h3>Simple Facts</h3>
    <p>A "Fact" is a simple statement comprised of 3 distinct parts - it's subject, predicate (verb) and it's object.</p>
    <pre> :Lee :drinks :Black_Coffee</pre>
    <p>We can further describe our world, to explain that:</p>
    <pre> :BlackCoffee  :kindOf     :Coffee</pre>
    <pre> :Coffee       :kindOf     :Beverage</pre>
    <p>Now we can ask questions like what beverages does :Lee drink. We have asked a logical question that was not stated in the data, but was inferred by referencing the meta data (:drinks).</p>

    <h3>Inferencing</h3>
    <p>Unlike a traditional database, RDF allows you to state anything you find interesting (ideally, it makes logical sense:)</p>
    <p>Also, each part of the fact statement can be further enhanced, so we can explain :drinks</p>
    <pre> :drink rdfs:domain :Drinker</pre>
    <pre> :drink rdfs:range :Beverage</pre>

    <p>We have instructed the rule base that the subject of :drink is a :Drinker, and the object is :Beverage.</p>
    <p>Our rules will create new statements that are logically correct.</p>

    <pre> :Lee          :drinks  :BlackCoffee</pre>
    <pre> :Lee          :drinks  :Coffee</pre>
    <pre> :Lee          :a       :Drinker</pre>
    <pre> :Coffee       :a       :Beverage</pre>
    <pre> :BlackCoffee  :a       :Beverage</pre>
    <p>It's how humans think. But not our data, databases or software systems - until now. It's not magic, it's not proprietary and it's not experimental. It's live, robust and mature.</p>

    <h3>Linked Data</h3>
    <p>Each atomic element of the statement is actually a URI - a globally unique identifier just like a web page. In fact some web pages already support embedded RDF.</p>
    <pre>http://example.com/whatis/BlackCoffee</pre>
    <p>Since each URI is globally addressable, it's possible to request more RDF that further expands the definition of :BlackCofee - perhaps that is suppliers, recipes or health related</p>
    <p>From the RDF that the BlackCoffee site provides about it's beverage, we find more statements. We can continue like this until all the world's <i>relevant</i> linked data is consumed.</p>
    <p>It's the links that matter. Those relationships provide meaning - hence the semantic web. Since all data can theoretically be called upon to explain itself, it makes for a very powerful knowledge management framework.</p>
    <h3>To Schema or Not Schema</h3>
    <p>A schema in SQL is a set of constraints that are imposed on the structure of the data. With RDF, a schema is a logical set of rules that infer further facts.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the data and meta-data are indistinguishable - all the tools and techniques that work with data also apply to meta-data.</p>
    <p>RDF is flexible and simple enough that it can describe queries, data models, user interfaces, validation rules, business processes, integration patterns and more.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> take those possibilities and provides the infrastructure and tooling needed to design, test, deliver, deploy and maintain sophisticated systems that rely upon smart data rather than smart code.</p>
