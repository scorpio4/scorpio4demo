    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>Assets are text-based files that play a key role in Scorpio<sup>4</sup>.
        Assets are roughly divided into two categories - scripts &amp; queries and everything else.</p>
    <p>Assets are distinguished by their mime type, a URI that describes how the contents should be understood.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Scripts</h3>
    <p>Scripts are mini-programs, they are triggered at useful times when your application runs.</p>
    <p>How and when each script is run is described by rules that are stored in your local repository.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> can run your scripts whenever you need them. Linking scripts into execution pipelines allows small scripts to play a big role. They make your software easier to build and maintain.</p>
    <p>Scripts can be run synchronously or asynchronously, depending upon the execution engine that is interpreting them.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <p>Queries are instructions to create, read, update or delete data in some data source.
        Scorpio<sup>4</sup> supports SQL and SPARQL queries. Other query engines are planned.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>HTML, XHTML, XML</h3>
    <h3>CSV, CSS, TXT</h3>
    <h3>Many more ...</h3>
    <p>The rest of the Assets are simply text files that can be used</p>
